        "A **weighted graph** is a graph $W = (V, E)$ equipped with a function $w \\colon E \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which assigns a **weight** to each edge. The weight of an edge $e \\in E$ is the value $w(e)$.  \n",

        "Any graph can be viewed as a weighted graph by assigning a weight of 1 to each of its edges.  \n",

        "The **geodesic distance** between two nodes in a weighted graph is defined as the smallest weight of path connecting them.\n",
        "Here, the length of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges it contains.  \n",

        "For unweighted graphs, the geodesic distance corresponds to the minimum number of edges traversed in a path connecting two nodes.  \n",

        "- **Usage:** Unweighted graphs (or graphs with uniform edge weights).\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Runs in $O(|V| + |E|)$ time, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges.\n",
        "- **Implementation:** Utilizes a queue to explore nodes level-by-level.\n",
        "- **Suitability:** Ideal for unweighted graphs or graphs where each edge has the same weight (e.g., weight $1$).\n",

        "## 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm\n",
        "- **Usage:** Weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights.\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** With a binary heap, it runs in $O(|E| \\log |V|)$; using a Fibonacci heap, it can achieve $O(|V| \\log |V| + |E|)$.\n",
        "- **Implementation:** Uses a priority queue to always expand the closest unvisited vertex.\n",
        "- **Suitability:** Best for graphs with non-negative weights; widely used in routing and navigation.\n",

        "- **Usage:** Graphs that may include negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).\n",

        "- **Implementation:** Iteratively relaxes all edges, updating the shortest distance estimates.\n",
        "- **Suitability:** Useful when negative weights are present and when detection of negative cycles is required.\n",

        "## 4. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
        "- **Usage:** All-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs.\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Runs in $O(|V|^3)$ time.\n",
        "- **Implementation:** Uses dynamic programming to compute the shortest distances between every pair of vertices.\n",
        "- **Suitability:** Best for dense graphs or when distances between all pairs of vertices are needed, though it is less efficient for very large sparse graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. A* Search Algorithm\n",
        "- **Usage:** Finding a single shortest path in weighted graphs with a well-defined heuristic.\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Depends on the quality of the heuristic; can be much faster than Dijkstra's algorithm when the heuristic is close to the actual distance.\n",
        "- **Implementation:** Combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a heuristic function $h(n)$ that estimates the distance from node $n$ to the target.\n",
        "- **Suitability:** Highly effective for spatial graphs (e.g., maps) where admissible heuristics (like Euclidean or Manhattan distances) can be used.\n",

        "## Summary Comparison\n",
        "- **BFS:** Simple and optimal for unweighted graphs.\n",
        "- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Standard choice for non-negative weighted graphs.\n",
        "- **Bellman-Ford:** Handles negative weights but with higher time complexity.\n",
        "- **Floyd-Warshall:** Suitable for all-pairs shortest paths, especially in smaller or denser graphs.\n",
        "- **A*:** Efficient when a good heuristic is available, reducing the search space for a specific target.\n"
